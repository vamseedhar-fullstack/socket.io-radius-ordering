# Socket.io Radius Ordering

This repository contains a real-time ordering system using Socket.io, designed to handle orders based on geographical radius. The application allows users to place orders, and the system notifies relevant agents within a specified radius for order fulfillment.

## Features

- **Real-Time Order Notifications**: Orders are broadcasted in real-time to agents within a defined geographical radius.
- **Geolocation-Based Matching**: Efficiently match orders with agents based on their proximity to the order location.
- **Socket.io Integration**: Utilizes Socket.io for seamless real-time communication between the server and connected clients.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle multiple orders and agents concurrently with minimal latency.
- **Customizable Radius**: Easily configure the radius for order notifications to target specific areas.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vamseedhar-fullstack/socket.io-radius-ordering.git
   cd socket.io-radius-ordering
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Node.js is installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure your environment settings:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   SOCKET_URL=your_socket_server_url
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place an Order**:
   - Clients can place an order by providing details such as the item, location, and any specific requirements.
   - The order will be broadcasted to all connected agents within the specified radius.

2. **Agent Notifications**:
   - Agents receive real-time notifications of new orders within their operational radius.
   - They can accept or reject orders directly from their interface.

3. **Order Tracking**:
   - Once an order is accepted, track its status in real-time until completion.

## Customization

- **Radius Settings**: Adjust the radius parameter in the configuration to change the geographical range for order notifications.
- **Notification Preferences**: Customize how and when agents are notified of new orders.
- **Order Matching Logic**: Modify the logic used to match orders with agents based on proximity.
